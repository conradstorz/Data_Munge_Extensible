        the payment of any installment of rent herein reserved, or in the event Tenant shall default in the
        performance of any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions herein contained binding upon
        Tenant and such default shall not be remedied, within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof
        shall have been given by Landlord to Tenant, or in the event Tenant shall be adjudicated a bankrupt
        or shall become insolvent or shall make a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or in
        the event a receiver shall be appointed for Tenant or a substantial part of its property and such
        receiver is not removed within ten (10) business days after appointment, Landlord shall to have the
        right (in addition to all other rights and remedies provided by law) to reenter and take possession
        of the Premises, peaceably or by force, to terminate this Lease and to remove any property therein,
        without liability for damage to, and without obligation to store, such property. In the event of such
        termination, Landlord shall use its best efforts to relet the Premises, or any part thereof, from time
        to time, in the name of Landlord or Tenant, without further notice, for such term or terms, on such
        conditions, and for such uses and purposes, as Landlord, in its reasonable discretion, may determine,
        and may collect and receive all rents derived therefrom and apply the same, after deduction of all
        appropriate expenses (including, without limitation, leasing commissions, the cost of readying the
        Premises for reletting; attorneys' fees and other costs of collection) to the payment of the rent
        payable hereunder, Tenant remaining liable for any failure to so relet the Premises or any part
        thereof, or for any failure to collect any rent connected therewith.

    (b) Landlord shall have the right without terminating or canceling this Lease to declare all
        amounts and rents and additional payments due under this Lease for the remainder of the existing
        term (or any applicable extension or renewal thereof) to be immediately due and payable, and
        thereupon all rents and other charges due hereunder to the end of the initial term or any renewal
        term, if applicable, offset by the then fair market value of the lease, shall be accelerated, at its net
        present value, calculated at the prime rate plus seven percent (prime + 7%).

    (c) If Landlord defaults in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder and fails to cure
        such default within thirty (30) days after written notice from Tenant, Tenant may perform on
        Landlords behalf and at Landlords costs or may terminate the Lease.

    claims, suits or actions for any damage or injury to the person or property caused by the erection,
    maintenance and operation of such signs or parts thereof.

34. No Waivers. 
    Any failure of either party hereto to insist upon strict observance of any
    covenant, provision or condition of this Lease in any one or more instances shall not constitute or
    be deemed a waiver, at that time or thereafter, of such or any other covenant, provision or condition
    of this Lease.

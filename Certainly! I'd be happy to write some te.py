Certainly! I'd be happy to write some tests for the main script using pytest. Based on the information provided, it seems we're working with a script that monitors a download folder for PDFs, extracts data from them, and saves that data to CSV files. Let's create some tests for this functionality using pytest.

First, let's create a new file called `test_pdf_processor.py` in the same directory as your main script. We'll assume your main script is called `pdf_processor.py`.

Here's an example of how we might structure our tests:

```python
import pytest
import os
import csv
from pdf_processor import Watcher, Handler, extract_and_save_data

# Mock the PDF reading functionality
@pytest.fixture
def mock_pdf_content(monkeypatch):
    def mock_extract_text(*args, **kwargs):
        return "This is mock PDF content"
    monkeypatch.setattr("PyPDF2.PdfFileReader.extract_text", mock_extract_text)

def test_extract_and_save_data(tmp_path, mock_pdf_content):
    # Create a mock PDF file
    pdf_path = tmp_path / "test.pdf"
    pdf_path.write_text("Mock PDF content")

    # Call the function
    extract_and_save_data(str(pdf_path))

    # Check if CSV file was created
    csv_files = list(tmp_path.glob("*.csv"))
    assert len(csv_files) == 1

    # Check CSV content
    with open(csv_files[0], 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        rows = list(reader)
        assert len(rows) == 1
        assert rows[0]['file_name'] == "test.pdf"
        assert rows[0]['content'] == "This is mock PDF content"

def test_handler_on_created(tmp_path, mock_pdf_content):
    handler = Handler()
    pdf_path = tmp_path / "new_test.pdf"
    pdf_path.write_text("Mock PDF content")

    class MockEvent:
        is_directory = False
        src_path = str(pdf_path)

    handler.on_created(MockEvent())

    csv_files = list(tmp_path.glob("*.csv"))
    assert len(csv_files) == 1

@pytest.mark.parametrize("file_name", ["test.txt", "test.doc", "test.pdf"])
def test_handler_file_types(file_name, tmp_path):
    handler = Handler()
    file_path = tmp_path / file_name
    file_path.write_text("Mock content")

    class MockEvent:
        is_directory = False
        src_path = str(file_path)

    handler.on_created(MockEvent())

    csv_files = list(tmp_path.glob("*.csv"))
    if file_name.endswith('.pdf'):
        assert len(csv_files) == 1
    else:
        assert len(csv_files) == 0
```

Let's break down these tests:

1. We use `pytest.fixture` to mock the PDF reading functionality. This allows us to test without actually reading real PDF files.

2. `test_extract_and_save_data` checks if the `extract_and_save_data` function correctly creates a CSV file with the expected content.

3. `test_handler_on_created` verifies that the `Handler` class correctly processes new PDF files.

4. `test_handler_file_types` uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test the `Handler` with different file types, ensuring it only processes PDF files.

To run these tests, you would typically use the command:

```
pytest test_pdf_processor.py
```

Remember to adjust the import statements and function names to match your actual implementation. Also, you might need to modify the tests slightly depending on the exact structure and behavior of your script.

These tests cover the main functionality of your script, but you might want to add more tests for edge cases, error handling, or specific behaviors unique to your implementation.
